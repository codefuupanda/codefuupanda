# 🐼 Hi, I'm codefuupanda  
💡 Curious about how logic, data, and creativity come together to make useful systems.

## About Me  

With each script, each project, and each line of logic, I’m learning to move with more understanding,  
to see how the small parts connect to the bigger picture of how things really work.  

Each project is like a small kata: a focused practice that sharpens both skill and patience.  
No shortcuts. Just curiosity, persistence and code.  

Code is my dojo, every commit it's a step to mastery. yet I’m not chasing perfection, just progress.
