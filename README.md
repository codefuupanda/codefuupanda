# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Placodelt  
ðŸ’¡ Curious about how logic, data, and creativity come together to make useful systems.

## About Me  
Iâ€™m still early in my programming journey, but I enjoy exploring every layer of how things work, from building simple web interfaces to understanding how data and infrastructure connect behind the scenes.  

I like learning how the small parts fit into the bigger picture. how code becomes a product, how a network supports an idea, how data flows between systems.  
Sometimes Iâ€™m focused on a single component in the frontend, and other times Iâ€™m trying to understand what happens deeper in the backend.  

Iâ€™m here to keep learning, experimenting, and improving, one step at a time.  
Every project teaches me something new, and thatâ€™s the part I enjoy most.
