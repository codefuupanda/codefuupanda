# 🐼 Hi, I'm codefuupanda  
💡 Curious about how logic, data, and creativity come together to make useful systems.

## About Me  
Like Po from *Kung Fu Panda*, I started clumsy and curious.  
But with each script, each project, each line of logic, I’m learning to move with purpose.  

Each project is a small kata a focused practice that sharpens both skill and patience.  
No shortcuts. Just curiosity, persistence, and code.

## My Code-Fu Path  
- 🧩 **Discipline** in structure  
- 💭 **Creativity** in problem-solving  
- 🌱 **Patience** in learning  

Code is my dojo. means every commit a step toward mastery.  
I’m not chasing perfection, just progress.
