# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Placodelt  
ðŸ’¡ Exploring how logic, data, and creativity can shape intelligent systems.

## ðŸ§  About Me  
I enjoy turning complex ideas into clear, practical solutions.  
My work often sits at the intersection of **data**, **automation**, and **thought** â€”  
asking not only *what* machines can do, but *why* and *how* they should do it.  

Can a machine truly **think**, or does it only follow patterns we design?  
That question inspires much of my curiosity about AI and the boundaries between human and artificial reasoning.  

Iâ€™m motivated by learning, building, and understanding â€” both how systems work and what they mean.
